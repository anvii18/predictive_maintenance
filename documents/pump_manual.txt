INDUSTRIAL PUMP & EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL
==============================================

NORMAL OPERATING RANGES:
- Temperature: 60-75°C
  Warning above 80°C
  Critical above 90°C
  Immediate shutdown above 95°C

- Vibration: 1.0-2.5 mm/s
  Warning above 3.0 mm/s
  Critical above 4.0 mm/s
  Immediate shutdown above 5.0 mm/s

- Pressure: 3.5-5.0 bar
  Warning below 3.0 bar
  Critical below 2.5 bar
  Immediate shutdown below 2.0 bar

- RPM: 1400-1500
  Warning below 1350

COMMON ISSUES AND CAUSES:

1. HIGH TEMPERATURE
   Possible Causes:
   - Blocked cooling fins or vents
   - Low coolant level
   - Failed cooling fan
   - Bearing friction due to wear
   - Overloading beyond rated capacity
   
   Immediate Actions:
   - Reduce machine load by 20%
   - Check coolant levels immediately
   - Inspect cooling fan operation
   - If temperature exceeds 90°C shut down within 10 minutes
   - If temperature exceeds 95°C shut down immediately

2. HIGH VIBRATION
   Possible Causes:
   - Worn or damaged bearings
   - Shaft misalignment
   - Loose mounting bolts
   - Imbalanced rotating components
   - Cavitation in pump
   
   Immediate Actions:
   - Stop machine for visual inspection
   - Check all mounting bolts for tightness
   - Inspect bearing condition
   - Check shaft alignment with alignment tool
   - If vibration exceeds 4.0 mm/s replace bearings immediately

3. LOW PRESSURE
   Possible Causes:
   - Leaking seals or gaskets
   - Blocked inlet valve
   - Worn pump impeller
   - Air trapped in system
   - Pipe leakage
   
   Immediate Actions:
   - Check all connection points for visible leaks
   - Inspect inlet and outlet valves
   - Bleed air from system
   - Check seal integrity
   - Verify pump impeller condition

MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE:
- Daily:   Visual inspection, oil level check
- Weekly:  Lubrication, filter inspection
- Monthly: Full bearing inspection, alignment check
- Quarterly: Complete overhaul and inspection

SPARE PARTS LIST:
- Bearing set (replace every 6 months)
- Shaft seals (replace every 3 months)
- Cooling fan belt (replace every 12 months)
- Filter cartridge (replace monthly)
